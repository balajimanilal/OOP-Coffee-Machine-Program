# OOP-Coffee-Machine-Program
This project simulates a coffee machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Users can purchase coffee drinks like espresso, latte, or cappuccino, and the machine keeps track of resources (water, milk, coffee), processes payments via coins, and manages the order flow for multiple coffee drinks.
